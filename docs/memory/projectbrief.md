# Project Brief: Excalidraw

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-03-28
**Status:** Active

---

## 1. Project Overview

Excalidraw is an open-source, browser-based virtual whiteboard application that enables users to create hand-drawn-style diagrams, sketches, and illustrations. The application is built as a React-based monorepo and delivered in two complementary forms:

1. **`excalidraw-app`** — A fully featured, deployable web application (hosted at [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com)) with real-time collaboration, cloud persistence via Firebase, and AI-assisted diagramming.
2. **`@excalidraw/excalidraw`** — A self-contained, embeddable React component package published to npm, enabling third-party developers to integrate the drawing canvas into their own products.

The tool targets a broad audience: individual creators, design teams, engineers doing technical diagramming, educators, and developers who want to embed a whiteboard component in their applications.

## 2. Objectives

### Business Objectives
- Deliver a best-in-class, zero-friction diagramming experience that works instantly in any modern browser with no account required.
- Grow ecosystem adoption by providing a high-quality, well-documented npm package (`@excalidraw/excalidraw`) for embedding.
- Drive conversion to Excalidraw Plus (paid tier) through in-app promotion while keeping the core product fully open-source.
- Maintain a healthy, active open-source community with a low barrier to contribution.

### Technical Objectives
- **Modularity:** Decompose the codebase into well-scoped packages (`common`, `element`, `math`, `utils`, `excalidraw`) enabling independent versioning and tree-shakeable consumption.
- **Performance:** Achieve smooth, low-latency rendering on large canvases using canvas-based rendering, virtual scene management, and optimistic UI updates.
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Support low-latency multi-user editing via Socket.IO with end-to-end encryption.
- **Offline-First:** Persist state locally (localStorage + IndexedDB) so the app is fully usable without internet connectivity.
- **Embeddability:** Export a clean, well-typed public API surface from the npm package for easy third-party integration.
- **Accessibility & Internationalisation:** Support multiple languages via i18n and comply with web accessibility standards.

## 5. Key Features

### Drawing & Editing
A rich, intuitive canvas with support for all common diagramming primitives. Elements are rendered using the HTML5 Canvas API and support full transformation (move, resize, rotate, mirror, crop). The hand-drawn aesthetic is achieved via the Rough.js-inspired rendering pipeline.

### Real-Time Collaboration
Users share a randomly generated room link. All scene mutations are synchronised via a Socket.IO WebSocket server. Payloads are end-to-end encrypted with AES-GCM before leaving the client; the server has no visibility into diagram content. Full-scene syncs occur on a 20-second interval as a safety net alongside incremental delta updates.

### End-to-End Encryption
Every collaborative session and shareable link embeds an AES-GCM encryption key in the URL fragment (never sent to the server). Files are stored encrypted in Firebase Storage. The encryption layer uses the Web Crypto API.

### AI-Assisted Diagramming (TTD — Text-to-Diagram)
An AI panel allows users to describe a diagram in natural language or provide Mermaid syntax; the system renders it onto the canvas. A "Diagram-to-Code" plugin exports a selected frame as an image to an AI backend for code generation. Chat history is persisted in IndexedDB.

### Offline-First & PWA
The app persists the entire scene to localStorage and binary files to IndexedDB on every change. A Vite-powered service worker enables installation and offline operation. Cross-tab sync ensures consistency when the app is open in multiple browser tabs.

### Embeddable React Component
`@excalidraw/excalidraw` provides a well-defined, TypeScript-typed React component and imperative API (`ExcalidrawImperativeAPI`). Consumers can control the scene programmatically, subscribe to events, and customise the UI surface.

### Library & Asset Management
Users maintain a personal shape library stored in IndexedDB. Libraries can be imported, exported, and published to the community library portal. File assets (images) are managed with reference counting and TTL-based cleanup.

### Charts & Data Import
Tabular data (e.g., from a spreadsheet) pasted into the canvas is parsed and rendered as bar, line, or radar charts composed of native Excalidraw elements.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** ≥ 60 fps canvas rendering; cursor sync ~30 fps (`CURSOR_SYNC_TIMEOUT = 33ms`); 4 MiB file upload limit (`FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES`); scene data compressed and delta-diffed over WebSocket.
- **Scalability:** Stateless client; Firebase handles persistence scalability; npm package is tree-shakeable and split into focused sub-packages.
- **Availability:** PWA service worker for offline use; local auto-save against data loss; Firebase/Socket.IO errors surfaced with offline indicators.
- **Security:** E2E encrypted (AES-GCM, 128-bit); keys in URL fragment only; no PII; secrets via env vars, never committed.
- **Compatibility:** Chrome ≥ 70, Firefox, Safari ≥ 12, Edge ≥ 79; Node.js ≥ 18; desktop-first, touch/pen via pointer events.
- **i18n & Accessibility:** i18n with locale detection and Crowdin translations; full keyboard navigation support.
- **Compliance:** MIT licensed; open-source-compatible deps; analytics (Sentry) opt-in via env vars, off by default in self-hosted.

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

### Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Firebase vendor lock-in for persistence and real-time sync | Medium | High | The data layer (`excalidraw-app/data/firebase.ts`) is abstracted behind a clear interface; migrating to an alternative backend is feasible with moderate effort. |
| WebSocket server availability for collaboration | Medium | High | The client gracefully degrades to offline mode; local persistence ensures no data loss. |
| Large scene performance degradation | Medium | Medium | Scene rendering is canvas-based (not DOM), virtual viewports limit off-screen work; incremental optimisation is ongoing. |
| npm package API breaking changes affecting downstream consumers | Low | High | Semantic versioning enforced; types are exported and reviewed; a `CHANGELOG` documents breaking changes. |
| Encryption key loss (URL fragment cleared) | Low | High | Users are advised to save the link; scenes are also auto-saved locally. |
| Browser compatibility regressions | Low | Medium | CI runs type-checking, lint, and unit/integration tests; browserslist targets are pinned. |
| Stale or conflicting collaboration state | Medium | Medium | Periodic full-scene syncs (`SYNC_FULL_SCENE_INTERVAL_MS = 20s`) and a reconciliation algorithm correct divergent state. |

### Assumptions

- Users have access to a modern evergreen browser; no legacy browser support is planned.
- The external collaboration WebSocket server and Firebase project are configured and operational independently of this repository.
- AI features (`TTDDialog`, `DiagramToCodePlugin`) require an external AI API endpoint provided via environment configuration.
- The Excalidraw Plus backend is a separate system; this repository only integrates with it at the UI prompt/redirect level.
- Translations are community-maintained via Crowdin; core engineering is not responsible for translation coverage of all locales.
- End users accept that collaboration room data is ephemeral (tied to room lifecycle) unless explicitly exported.
