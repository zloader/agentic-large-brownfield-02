# Skill: Memory Bank Update

## When to use

After significant code changes: new features, refactors,
architecture changes, dependency updates, or completed milestones.
Triggered by: "update memory bank", "sync docs",
"refresh project docs".

## Inputs

- What changed (from git diff, conversation, or user description)

## Steps

1. Run `git diff --stat HEAD~5` to identify recent changes
2. Read relevant Memory Bank files in `docs/memory/`
3. For each changed area, update the matching file:
  - New feature → `progress.md` + `activeContext.md`
  - Architecture change → `systemPatterns.md` + `decisionLog.md`
  - Dependency change → `techContext.md`
  - Scope change → `projectbrief.md` + `productContext.md`
4. Verify updated content against actual source code
5. Ensure each file stays under 200 lines

## Outputs

- List of updated Memory Bank files
- Summary of what changed and why

## Safety

- Do NOT remove manually curated content without asking
- Do NOT add speculative information — only verified facts
- Do NOT exceed 200 lines per file — summarize if needed
- Verify ALL technical claims against actual code
